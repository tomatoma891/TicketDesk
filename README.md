# TicketDesk

## Overview: 
Ticket system application built with the MERN stack to allow teams to manage bugs, requests, and other support tickets.

## User story: 
As a user I want to log-in to access my employee account, and view all ticket requests. Once I click on a ticket I am able to view a “ticket modal” with all pertinent information enclosed. Lastly, I want to create a new ticket or update an existing ticket to post to database.
